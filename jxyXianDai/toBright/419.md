    <td bgcolor="#C0C0C0" style="line-height: 21px;">完整校对版（汉军威武请戒色论坛网友翻译，特表感谢）：<BR><BR>站长,您好！请帮忙用中文翻译我的邪淫故事，那样可以让读者受益并且不再重复我的错误。<BR><BR>我今年28岁，三年前从新加坡的一所顶尖大学毕业。这三年中，我事业无发展并且换了很多次工作。我认为这是由我的邪淫恶业所带来的报应。<BR><BR>我在2004年遇到了一个已婚女人并且和她发生了性关系。她向我撒谎说她是单身的。但后来我发现实际上她已经结婚了，但她搬出了她的住所并住在一个单元房中，因为她的丈夫不能满足她的性要求。<BR><BR>我仍然和她保持着性关系一直到2006年为止。她的丈夫请了一个私家侦探来调查我们，最终他们离婚了。我觉得是我的错误造成他们离婚的。<BR><BR>随后，我换了我的手机号码并且告诉自己不要再和她联系。但是在2007年，我见了她一次并和她发生了性关系。我知道我不应该那样做。<BR><BR>此外，在2007年，我从网上认识了一个女孩并和她发生了一夜情。我去检查了HIV并测出是阴性，我很庆幸。<BR><BR>在过去的15年里我一直看色情的东西并且手淫。我告诉自己停止或者减少手淫的频率。因为我每天晚上要手淫3至4小时。<BR><BR>直到今天，我不手淫的最多天数是5天，在此之后欲望就又会来。<BR><BR>我比大多数男人性欲要高，并且早在我19岁的时候我就习惯去红灯区找妓女。甚至和妓女发生性关系后，我回家还会手淫。<BR><BR>最近，我从网上认识了一个人，他带我去红灯区。他支付70美元让我和一个中国妓女去旅馆做爱。我告诉自己我不应该与她发生关系。因为当我已经有测出HIV为阴性的经历，我不想再受精神上的折磨再去测试一次HIV。<BR><BR>我给那个妓女钱并且告诉她不用做爱，只要给我按摩就行了。<BR><BR>总之，报应很快来了。几天后，我在我的阴茎上发现了一个蘑菇形状的东西（尽管那个女孩没有碰我的私密处，但我相信这是报应）。<BR><BR>这几年我善恶业掺杂不断。善业方面，我自愿的去参加葬礼诵经会，放生，助印，禅坐。<BR><BR>恶业方面是我一直在发生不正当的性行为，并且这是最邪恶的。我一直在饱尝恶业果报，尽管我做了一些善事，可是这好比一个充满漏洞的杯子（恶业）我却想要把这杯子装满水（善业）。自然杯子总仍是空的。 <BR><BR>这几年，我没有一份工作是做满7个月的。我总是遇上不友好的同事和难相处的人。在这三年里我已经换了10份工作，都总是输在我的简历上。所以我请了个家庭老师教了我2年。<BR><BR>今年，我曾得到一些很好的面试机会，但最后我都没有去参加。因为我手淫总是直到凌晨4，5点而那以后我往往非常累，起不了床。有时候，我会把闹钟关了并且不去参加面试。现在已到了非常严重的地步了。我恨我自己！<BR><BR>我已经失业有4个月了。并且我的积蓄也没多少了。我仍然睡的很迟，凌晨4点睡下，在下午2点醒来后又再小睡一会儿到傍晚的6点。我只应聘晚间的工作。当有的公司打电话让我去面试的时候，我的手机总处于关机状态。所以我错过了很多好机会。甚至当我面试时，面试的人要求我等他们的电话通知。我非常累并且懒得去听那些。<BR><BR>曾有一个临时任务需要我在星期二开始工作，但是第二天我没有起来工作因为我把闹钟关了。并且我没有告知公司，因为我不知道该怎么说。我真的希望我可以跟正常人一样早睡早起去工作。<BR><BR>因一次偶然机会，我来到了你们的网站。看到这里的很多网友都在遭受邪淫行为带来的果报折磨，我真的很难过。希望所有人可以不再受其折磨！<BR><BR>衷心希望各位读者不要重复我的错误并能从我的错误中吸取教训。<BR><BR>请大家记住这是真实的：邪淫会导致一个人有许多敌人（在工作中，遇到许多不友好的同事和敌人）；邪淫也会减少一个人的运气（没事业）；邪淫也会遇不到虔诚信佛学佛的好女孩（这三年中我找不到好的女友，我所接触的女孩都只是为了性。）<BR>　　　　<BR><BR>附录：来信原文<BR><BR>　　Hi <BR>webmaster, pls help to translate my story of sexual <BR>misconduct in chinese, so that other readers can all <BR>benefit and learn not to repeat my mistake.<BR><BR>　　I am 28 this year, having <BR>graduated from a top university in singapore 3 years <BR>ago. These 3 years, i have not been able to progress <BR>in my career and have been switching many jobs. I believe this is the karmic <BR>result of sexual misconduct. <BR>　　I met a married woman in year 2004 and have sexual relations with <BR>her. She had lied to me that she was single but later i found out actually she was married, but she moved out to <BR>stay by herself in an unit, as her husband cannot satisfy her sexually.<BR><BR>　　I still continued my <BR>sexual relationship with her till year 2006. Her husband had sent a private <BR>investigator to check on us, and eventually they filed for divorce. I felt it <BR>was my fault for their divorce. <BR>　　Subsequently, i changed my handphone number and told myself not to contact her again. <BR>But in year 2007, i met her once to have sex. I knew <BR>i should not do that.<BR><BR>　　Also, in year 2007, i met a gal from the internet and had a one night stand <BR>with her. I tested negative for HIV laterwards and <BR>was glad of that.<BR><BR>　　I <BR>have been watching porn and masturbating for the past 15 years. I told myself <BR>to stop or reduce the frequency. I used to masturbate every night for 3 to 4 <BR>hours.<BR><BR>　　Till today, <BR>the maximum days i do not masturbate is 5 days, <BR>after which the urge will come.<BR><BR>　　I have a higher sex drive than most men, and i used to go to the red light districts to pay prostitutes <BR>for sex when i was just 19 years old. Even after <BR>having sex with prostitutes, i will still go home <BR>and shou yin.<BR><BR>　　Recently, i met this guy from the internet and he brought me to the <BR>red light district. He paid $70 for me to have paid sex with a china <BR>prostitute and i went up the hotel room. I told <BR>myself i should not have sex with her as i am tested HIV negative and do not want to go through the <BR>mental suffering of getting tested for HIV again. <BR>　　But i gave the money to the prostitute and told her no need do <BR>sex. Do massage for me.<BR><BR>　　Anyway, retribution come quickly. A few <BR>days later, i found out a mushroom like skin <BR>attached to my penis( although the girl didnt touch my privates, but i <BR>believe this is retribution). <BR>　　I have been doing good and evil these few years. I have went for voluntary funeral chanting sessions, release <BR>animal life in life liberation sessions, print dhamma books, meditation. <BR>　　The evil i done is sexual misconduct, and that is the most evil of <BR>all. I have been tasting the fruits of it. Though <BR>i done some good deeds, it's like a cup full of <BR>holes(evil deeds) and i am <BR>trying to fill the cup with water(good deeds). The cup is still empty.<BR><BR>　　This few years, i could not stay more than 7 months in a job, always <BR>meeting with unfriendly colleagues and difficult people. I have already <BR>changed over 10 jobs these 3 years and ended up lying in my resume that i gave private tutoring for 2 years. <BR>　　This year, i have good interviews for me, but i ended up not going for them as i was very tired after shou yin <BR>till 4 to 5 am in the morning. Or sometimes, i will <BR>turn off the alarm clock and not go interview. It is very serious now. I hated <BR>myself for that.<BR><BR>　　I <BR>have been without a job for 4 months now and my savings are going low. I still <BR>sleep late abt 4am in the morning, wake up 2pm and <BR>then have a nap again till 6pm. I only apply job at night and when the <BR>companies call me for interview, my phone is off. As such, i miss many good opportunities. And even when i attend interview, the interviewers will ask me to wait <BR>for their phone call. I am so tired and sick of hearing that. <BR>　　There was this temp <BR>assignment i had started work on tuesday, but the next day i didnt turn up for work as <BR>i turned off the alarm clock. I did not inform the <BR>company too, as i did not know what to say. <BR>　　I really hope i can sleep early and wake up early so that i can go work, like other people.<BR><BR>　　I had come across your <BR>website by chance and am glad to see many people here suffering from the karma <BR>of sexual misconduct and hope that all can be free of this.<BR><BR>　　I read that reciting namo guan shi yin pu sha can reduce our sexual <BR>desire and i will work on that.<BR><BR>　　May readers not repeat my <BR>mistake and learn from it. <BR>　　It is indeed true that sexual misconduct will lead one to having <BR>many enemies( in work, many unfriendly colleagues and enemies), also reduce <BR>one's fortune( no career), also can't meet the right girl who is a practising buddhist(these 3 <BR>years can't find the right girlfriend, the girls i <BR>meet are all for sex only)<BR>　　</td>
